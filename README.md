## Problem Solving Template

### Python Template

```python
def solution():
    """
    Problem Description:

    Approach:

    Time Complexity:
    Space Complexity:
    """
    pass

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Add test cases here
    pass
```

### C++ Template

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Problem Description:

    // Approach:

    // Time Complexity:
    // Space Complexity:

    void solution() {
        // Implementation
    }
};

int main() {
    // Add test cases here
    return 0;
}
```
